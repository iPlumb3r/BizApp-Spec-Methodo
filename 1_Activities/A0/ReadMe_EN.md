# Activity "A0" : Define the purpose of the application

## Goal
It is a question of defining the purpose of the application, its "Why?", its "raison d'Ãªtre", ...   
... in other words to specify "to whom" and "what" it will be used for and for what benefit.

### Why do it ?
Because in order to specify a __computer application__, it is necessary to determine the __semantic model of the business concepts (or business model)__ which will have to be manipulated ...   
... and that fundamentally, a __business model__ only makes sense in relation to _"what it is going to be used for"_ !
> For memo: "Essentially, all models are __wrong__ , but some are _useful_" - Geoges Box

### How do you do it?
By asking ourselves the following triple question : 
* "where" do we want to go ?
* what are the potential difficulties on the "way" ?
* what are we going to put in place to get to "destination" despite the pitfalls ?

## Mantra
The best advice for this activity is undoubtedly embodied in the saying:
> "There is no favorable wind for the sailor who doesn't know where to go !"

## Deliverable
The __"motivation map"__ is often a necessary and sufficient deliverable for this activity ...     
... Because it is made up of 3 types of elements which, taken as a whole, give a good picture of the ins and outs of a project !

These types of elements are as follows :
* The __business finalities__
* The __influential factors__
* The __business initiatives__
