# Activity "A2" : Identify and define the business subject handled by the application

## Goal
It is a question of identifying and defining precisely the subjects which will have to be handled by the target application ...   
... in other words, to determine "what is it about" the field of knowledge that it must support.

### Why do it?
The 1st reason is related to the previous step which allows to identify the __Business Objects__ which are in fact only representations of the "real" __Business Topics__ which structure the __knowledge domain underlying the computer application.
The 2nd reason is related to the next step which requires to put in relation things which have been previously perfectly defined. Otherwise, linking things that don't make sense will not make sense either!

### How to do it ?
By systematically looking for the __Business Subject__ that is "behind" each __Business Object__ identified during the previous step through questions such as :
* What does it document ?
* What does it represent?

## Mantra
Perhaps the best advice for this activity is this : 
> Focus on capturing the "real" __subjects__ of the knowledge domain...     
... and not the __objects__ that represent them!

## Deliverable
The __Conceptionary__ is not only the only deliverable for this activity, ...   
... But it is also THE deliverable of this methodological approach because it constitutes a "pivot" of the approach!   
 
## Key Concepts
The key concepts for this activity are summarized in the table below :

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Conceptionary Entry</th>
            <th>Card (Min-Max)</th>
            <th>Comment</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Concept ID</td>
            <td>1-1</td>
            <td>Could be a number, a ramdom alpha-numeric chain or an EnglishCamelCase "word"</td>
        </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>============</td>
            <td>And For Each Language</td>
            <td>============</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Prefered Label</td>
            <td>1-1</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Alternative Label</td>
            <td>0-N</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Description</td>
            <td>1-1</td>
            <td>The description must refers to others concepts (via the Concept ID) in order to prepare the work for building the future ontology</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Comment</td>
            <td>0-N</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Example</td>
            <td>3-7</td>
            <td>Some representative individuals/instances of the concept</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Notes
Each entry in the __Conceptionary__ is a Concept (NOT a Term).
> In some sense we can say that a __Conceptionary__ is an inverted __Dictionary__!
