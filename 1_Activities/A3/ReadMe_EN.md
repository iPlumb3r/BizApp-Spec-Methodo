# Activity "A3": Linking business concepts 

## Goal
It is a matter of connecting the __Business Topics__ previously defined in the Conceptionary (and possibly some __Key Business Objects__) in a global model ...   
... in other words to specify the semantic model of the business concepts.

### Why do it?
Because a __knowledge domain__ is as much represented by the __Business Concepts__ (especially the __Business Subjects__) that constitute it as by the __Relationships__ between these concepts.

### How to do it?
By looking for the meaning, the signification, the semantics ... of the links that connect the __Business Subjects__ to each other!

## Mantra
Perhaps the best advice for this activity is this : 
> "When the territory and the map disagree, believe the territory" - Swiss Army Manual. 

## Deliverable
The __Sematic Model of Business Concepts__ is the only deliverable for this activity. It essentially comprises the __Business Topics__ of the knowledge domain; and potentially also __Business Objects__.   
It usually consists of one or more graphs.
 
## Key Concepts
The key concepts for this activity are as follows : 
* __Business Concept__ : All __Business Subjects__ and __Business Object__.
* __Trade Subject__ : "Real" focus of the knowledge area
* __Business Object__: Representation - usually (but not only) documentary - of a __Business Subject__.
