Activities to be realized
==

The activities required for this methodology are the following ones : 

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Id</th>
            <th>What ?</th>
            <th>Why ?</th>
            <th>How ? (=> Delivrable)</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/BizApp-Spec-Methodo/blob/master/1_Activities/A0/ReadMe_EN.md">A0</a></td>            
            <td>Define the application finality</td>
            <td>A business model only makes sense in terms of "what it's going to be used for.". Rq : All models are wrong , but some are useful (G. Box)</td>
            <td>By identifying the finalities to be achieved by the business model, the influencing factors and the resulting initiatives (=> Motivation map)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/BizApp-Spec-Methodo/blob/master/1_Activities/A1/ReadMe_EN.md">A1</a></td>            
            <td>Define the business scope of the IT application</td>
            <td>If the business scope is not clearly defined, it will be impossible to effectively capture the business need and control iterative development cycles (risk of cost and time slippage).</td>
            <td>By identifying the business activities that will have to be supported by the IT application. (=> Map of “Who realises which activity ?”)</td>
        </tr>          
        <tr>
            <td><a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/BizApp-Spec-Methodo/blob/master/1_Activities/A2/ReadMe_EN.md">A2</a></td>  
            <td>Identify and define the business concepts that will have to be manipulated by the IT application.</td>
            <td>If the business concepts are not clearly identified and defined, it will be impossible to know "what exactly we are talking about" and the quality of the application will not be there. !</td>
            <td>By building a business glossary where each entry embodies a business concept and includes: 1 preferred label, 1 (or more) alternative label(s), 1 definition, 1 comment and 3 to 5 examples. (=> Onto-terminological glossary)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>A3</td>  
            <td>Link business concepts via semantic relations</td>
            <td>For to describe a business "territory", the relationships between business concepts are just as important (or even more important ;-) as the business concepts themselves.</td>
            <td>By building a semantic model of business concepts that can be represented by 1 or more graphs. (=> Semantic business concept model)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>A4</td> 
            <td>Describe the business rules</td>
            <td>To bring out the business rules that control and/or constrain the semantic model of business concepts</td>
            <td>By explaining "what the application should do" using the business concepts previously identified in the glossary. (=> List of business rules)</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
