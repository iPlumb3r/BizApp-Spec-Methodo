Activities to be realizes
==

The activities required for this methodology are the following ones : 


Table:
<Table.
    <Head.
        <I don't know.
            <What? Th...
            <Why? Th? Why?
            <How? (=> Deliverable)</th>
        </I don't know.
    </thead>
    <Body.
        <I don't know.
            <d> Define the purpose of the application</td>
            <A business model only makes sense in terms of "what it's going to be used for". Rq : All models are wrong , but some are useful (G. Box)</td>
            <By listing the objectives to be achieved by the business model (=> Motivation map</td>).
        </I don't know.
        <I don't know.
            <td> Define the business scope of the IT application </td>
            <If the business scope is not clearly defined, it will be impossible to effectively capture the business need and control iterative development cycles (risk of cost and time slippage).
            <By identifying the business activities that will need to be supported by the IT application. (=> Mapping "Who carries out which activity?")</td>.
        </I don't know.
        <I don't know.
            <Identify and define the business concepts that will have to be manipulated by the computer application.
            <If business concepts are not clearly identified and defined, it will be impossible to know "what exactly we're talking about" and the quality of the application will not be there!
            <By building a business glossary where each entry embodies a business concept and includes: 1 preferred label, 1 (or more) alternative label(s), 1 definition, 1 comment and 3 to 5 examples. (=> On-terminology glossary)</td>.
        </I don't know.
        <I don't know.
            <td> Relate business concepts via semantic relations (i.e. "meaning bearer")</td>
            <Because to describe a business "territory", the relationships between business concepts are just as important (or even more important ;-) as the business concepts themselves</td>.
            <By building a semantic model of business concepts that can be represented by 1 or more graphs. (=> Semantic model of the business concepts)</td>.
        </I don't know.
        <I don't know.
            <Describe the business rules</td>
            <To bring out the business rules that control and/or constrain the semantic model of business concepts.
            <By explaining "what the application should do" using the business concepts previously identified in the glossary. (=> List of business rules)</td>
        </I don't know.
