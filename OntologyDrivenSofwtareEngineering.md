Ontology-Driven Sofwtare Engineering
==
Ontology Driven Software Enginnering is based on the MVC (Model-View-Controler) paradigm where :   
* The "Model" is an Ontology
* The "Controler" is a set of SWRL Rules
* The "View" is the User Interface (as usual)  

In this context the business logic of the application is NOT implemented with "classical" code ...    
... but it is - only - determined (deduced, inferred, ...) by the Ontology and the SWRL Rules
