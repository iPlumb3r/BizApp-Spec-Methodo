Preamble
-
This __methodology__ incarnates the common core of __good practices__ to be implemented upstream of the development of a business application, whatever the __development method__ of this application: 
* traditional
* or "ontology-driven"

=> Indeed, in both cases, it is necessary to specify __"what must be done, regardless of how it is done"__!
