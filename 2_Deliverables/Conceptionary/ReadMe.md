Conceptionary
==

What is it ?
-
A __conceptionary__ is a "flat" list of the __concepts__ related to a given __knowledge domain__ with some useful associated informations :

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Conceptionary Entry</th>
            <th>Card (Min-Max)</th>
            <th>Comment</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Concept ID</td>
            <td>1-1</td>
            <td>Could be a number, an aleatory alpha-numeric chain or an EnglishCamelCase "word"</td>
        </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>============</td>
            <td>And For Each Language</td>
            <td>============</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Prefered Label</td>
            <td>1-1</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Alternative Label</td>
            <td>0-N</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Description</td>
            <td>1-1</td>
            <td>The description must refers to others concepts (via the Concept ID) in order to prepare the work for building the future ontology</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Comment</td>
            <td>0-N</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Example</td>
            <td>3-7</td>
            <td>Some representativ instance of the concept</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

__Important note__ :   
Each entry of the conceptionary is NOT a #Term ...   
... this is a #Concept   
> A Conceptionary is somewhere a "inverse Dictionary"

What's the point ?
-
A __conceptionary__ is like _"a stone in the middle of the river"_ is the process to built an __ontology__.   
Less formal than an __ontology__, the __conceptionary__ let appears future formal relations - in a textual flavor - inside the description section.

An example
-
An exemple of a Conceptionary could be see here :
* <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/EcosystemMapping/tree/master/1_Semantic/Conceptionary">Root</a> of the Conceptionary   
* <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/EcosystemMapping/blob/master/1_Semantic/Conceptionary/%40Agent.md">Info Card</a> for the Concept identified as "@Agent"   
=> You can see here than the "Description" of the Concept referes to others Concept(s) of the Conceptionary ...   
... and you can navigate through those links in order to see the "Description" of the targeted Concept(s) !

__Note__ : GitHub is OK for publich the final version of an already built Conceptionary, but not for building it !!!


Which tool to use ?
-

Traditional "Office" applications (such as Word, Excel, Power Point, Mind Manager, ...) are not very suitable for building a conceptionary, just because main requirements are : 
   - Concepts can be linked easily
   - Allow Collaboration
   
 
 Seems that the best tool which answer to both requirements is <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam</a> 
 (You need to create 1 Roam Note for each Concept => Do NOT describe several Concepts in the same Roam Note)

Template/Example : 
* Roam Note 1 :<a href="https://roamresearch.com/#/app/EntangledBootstrap/page/1fZzExIam">Template</a>   
* Roam Note 2 : <a href="https://roamresearch.com/#/app/EntangledBootstrap/page/S5u8LXV2A">Example</a>  

> By creating new Roam Note, with the name of already used Concept, Roam will automatically propose to make a link ...
