Conceptionary
==

What is it ?
-
A __conceptionary__ is a "flat" list of the __concepts__ related to a given __knowledge domain__ with some useful associated informations :

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Conceptionary Entry</th>
            <th>Card (Min-Max)</th>
            <th>Comment</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Concept ID</td>
            <td>1-1</td>
            <td>Could be a number, an aleatory alpha-numeric chain or an EnglishCamelCase "word"</td>
        </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>============</td>
            <td>And For Each Language</td>
            <td>============</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Prefered Label</td>
            <td>1-1</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Alternative Label</td>
            <td>0-N</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Description</td>
            <td>1-1</td>
            <td>The description must refers to others concepts (via the Concept ID) in order to prepare the work for building the future ontology</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Comment</td>
            <td>0-N</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Example</td>
            <td>3-7</td>
            <td>Some representativ instance of the concept</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
* ID (1-1)   

__Important note__ :   
Each entry of the conceptionary is NOT a #Term ...   
... this is a #Concept   
=> A Conceptionary is somewhere a "inverse Dictionary"

What's the point ?
-
A __conceptionary__ is like _"a stone in the middle of the river"_ is the process to built an __ontology__.   
Less formal than an __ontology__, the __conceptionary__ let appears future formal relations - in a textual flavor - inside the description section.
